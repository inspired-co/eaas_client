Distance may bring space and time barriers, but it brings human beings closer together as a community. When far-reaching love encompasses all human beings, distance can be easily eliminated. The more critical and desperate the situation is, the more we can study the ordinary and great human nature. Across the distance of winter, love connects human feelings, faith and the whole world, returning spring to earth.

{"source": "People were originally scattered beads, seemingly scattered by the waves of the epidemic. However, with love as the thread, each person was tightly connected and united into an indestructible force. Thus, although the whale wave is 10,000 miles in front of us, we can navigate it with love as a reed. When the virus is in danger, the warmth of love will help to resolve the alienation. With the epidemic, people are on tenterhooks, masks are worn, homes are isolated, and the distance seems to dilute the hustle and bustle of the Spring Festival and the laughter that should be flowing under the cherry blossom trees. However, as you can see, the community's epidemic prevention was carried out in an orderly manner, volunteers were running around, neighbors were helping each other, true love and goodwill were flowing and passing on in the fight against the epidemic, and the traditional virtue of keeping and helping each other was more fragrant. Didn't the little boy's salute from afar after delivering the mask make you and I stand in awe? The pair of young lovers in the hospital corridor at both ends of the open arms, did not embrace each other's souls? The \"one-meter line\" is never a \"sad thick barrier\" between us, it isolates the virus, not love. When warmth and love nourish our common spiritual home, the distance is not unbridgeable. When the epidemic is raging, the burning hearts of individuals and nations become one. The people who laughed and laughed when the four seas were at peace, in the gloomy and depressing days, could also stand up for the reunion of the Chinese land, and resolutely ran to distant places. Have not forgotten, Zhong Nanshan aged old age please go to the battlefield, the invitation to war on the bright red fingerprints oath resounding, protective clothing to block the sight, it is difficult to hide the soul red makeup; have not forgotten, New Year's Eve half Vulcan Hill Hospital site in the New Year's Eve dinner, couriers turned themselves into the city's bridge, the five lakes and four seas of fundraising hugely ...... \"I have since not humiliate the mission, so that I can meet with all beings.\" Socrates aphorism like a torch. Every one of you and I have a heat will send a point of light, and then the fireflies converge into a river of stars, and finally exchanged for the melting of ice and snow spring back to the earth, laughter all over the mountains and rivers. When the burning love lights up the color of our common faith, the distance between you and me will melt. In the gloom and doom, the broad mind contains human beings. A thousand miles of the same good, solid in glue and paint, firm in gold and stone. The Chinese people have always taken the world as their responsibility, and Chinese materials have been sent to help other countries, and Chinese experience has been shared with the world, pursuing the highest realm of Mencius' thought of \"human harmony\" with practical actions. \"In the face of the epidemic, countries around the world have clenched their fists across the oceans. Russell regarded \"unquenchable sympathy for human suffering\" as one of the pure and strong emotions that dominated his life. It is a broader love: the distant worries, partings and griefs that are happening between you and me, and the warmth and strength that comes from each of us. Distance may bring space and time barriers, but it brings human beings closer together as a community. When far-reaching love encompasses all human beings, distance can be easily eliminated. The more critical and desperate the situation is, the more we can study the ordinary and great human nature.
